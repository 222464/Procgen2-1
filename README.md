Procgen2 is a community rewrite of https://github.com/openai/procgen. This project originally began with the plan of serving as a maintained fork of Procgen with support for the standard Gymnasium API instead of Gym3, along with a documentation website and environment bugs fixed. This project evolved into a rewrite due to concerns about code structure and maintainability, memory leaks, performance, and other large issues. Some initial work for this project before the plans for a rewrite came to fruition is in https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Procgen-Staging. This project also plans to release the evaluation environments from OpenAI's contest for the first time, which we were able to get initially released here: https://github.com/openai/procgen/tree/contest-envs
